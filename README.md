## Main Stack
In this template you can see modern stack of technologies:

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - this is it ;)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - HTML-template engine
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - cool css-preprocessor
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - compiling your ES6 javascript for better supporting


## Installation

Template requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), install this if you haven't yet.
Next, you need to install dependencies via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm i
```

> all following steps we will do with npm, but you can type `gulp start` or something else after installing
> Optional: you also able to install in your IDE this plugins: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

All done! To launch this template you can write:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Main Plugins

Template currently works with the following plugins.
Description on what plugins are included is below.

| Plugin | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) | JavaScript compiler |
| [Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) | JavaScript linter |
| [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) | The streaming build system |
| [gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) | Prefix CSS |
| [gulp-group-css-media-queries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-group-css-media-queries) | Groups your media queries |
| [gulp-pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-pug) | Gulp plugin for compiling Pug templates |
| [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) | Gulp plugin for compiling Sass templates |
| [gulp-ttf2woff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ttf2woff) | Create a WOFF font from a TTF |
| [gulp-ttf2woff2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ttf2woff2) | Create a WOFF2 font from a TTF |

This is not the full list of plugins, you can open `${package.json}`
to see all plugins that I used in this template.

## Additional tasks

I made optional tasks to make your developing more comfortable.
You can run:
```
npm run font
```
To compile your TTF fonts to WOFF/WOFF2, this is easy!

Also you can minify your images after build, write:
```
npm run img
```

This task will take all your images from `src` and minify them,
then it will unload them to `dist` folder.


#### Building
After coding, you can build your project via
```
npm run build
```
